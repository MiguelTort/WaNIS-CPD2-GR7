# WaNIS-CPD2-GR7
LBYCPD2-EQ1 Group7 Project Repository

This is the repository for the Weather and News Integrated Scheduler (WaNIS) Project.

This Project is a Web Application that functions mainly as a personal scheduler, but its unique features are the enabling of push notifications that relate to weather and news that the software deems relevant to the user's time management and schedule.
The Objective of this project is the creation of a more innovative scheduling application that should prove to be significantly more functional than generic calendar applications or real-world planners that are commonly used today.
